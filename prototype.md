- Minimongo to save data on client --> easy to implement PWAs
- Realtime synchronisation between clients by default
- Easy to define database schema with little boilerplate code


Disadvantages:
- Slow build times in hot reload especially with many packages
- Relatively complex to switch framework due to code-sharing
- Hard to separate frontend and backend development due to code-sharing
- Difficulty to deploy front end to CDN
- Scaling could be complex with many concurrent users (untested)
- Only supports mongodb
